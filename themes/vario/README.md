# Vario Theme

## Vario Theme - Details

Vario is a clean, modern, mobile-first theme built for 2017! Vario is built to load quickly, with lightweight file sizes. It's also easily customisable, and can be edited either with simple HTML via the CMS area (or a code editor), or via the Static Pages plugin.

The theme is built on the modern Kube framework (https://imperavi.com/kube/), which emphisises design, minimalism and typography. It uses an easily customisable flexbox grid (https://imperavi.com/kube/docs).

## Features

- Different color themes (".red-theme", ".silver-theme" default white) which can be changed by simply changing the class on the body tag. You can also remove the class for the default white theme which can easily be customised with your own colors.
- Three pages, plus a blog
- Multiple components ready to be added including:
  - Three header variations
  - Three footer styles
  - Three grid patterns
  - A carousel
  - Additional components for tabs, breadcrumbs, pricing plans and more

## Vario Theme - Documentation

If editing HTML, use the standard vario.htm layout file for each page. If editing via Static Pages plugin, use the vario-static.htm layout file.

Support for Static Pages plugin is in beta, and may require a small amount of setup. If using the static header you will need to change the component HTML for the CSS to apply correctly, and to change the logo. You can see an example of this here: https://github.com/andreobriennz/Vario-Theme-OctoberCMS/tree/master/plugins/rainlab/pages/components/staticmenu
However this only applies if editing the header with the static pages plugin.
